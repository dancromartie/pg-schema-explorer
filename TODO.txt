Fancy: make a table schemadoc.required_client_version it can just have one row
with a git hash or a semantic version.  When clients connect, it can say
whether its out of date or not.

Show what output would look like in a <pre> in a browser, but probably should
stop short of putting it in any app.  You could just print the HTML to a local
file.
